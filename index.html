          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p><strong>My name is Andrew Borlin. I’m 16 years old and have been a 4-H member for four years.</strong><br>
            This year, I’m raising both a rabbit and a turkey as part of my livestock projects. Through 4-H, I’ve
            learned how to manage time, stick to a budget, care for animals, and follow through on long-term goals.</p>

          <p>My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack web developer. 4-H is helping me build the discipline,
            problem-solving skills, and work ethic I’ll need to get there.</p>

        <h1>Why 4-H Matters — and Why Your Support Counts</h1>

        <p>
          4-H is a national youth program backed by the USDA that teaches real-world skills through hands-on projects.
          Whether it’s raising animals, managing a budget, presenting to an audience, or building a robot, 4-H helps
          young
          people like me develop responsibility, leadership, and problem-solving abilities that actually prepare us for
          life.
        </p>

        <p>
          This year, I’m raising a market turkey and a rabbit meat pen (three rabbits sold together).
        </p>

        <p>
          These projects come with real costs: feed, housing, equipment, and entry fees. Donations made
          through the 4-H Add-On Program go directly toward those expenses and help me save for future education.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your support isn’t just appreciated—it’s an investment in someone showing up, doing the work, and learning
          what it takes to succeed.

        <h2>How to Donate</h2>

        <p>There are two main ways you can support me and other 4-H members:</p>

        <h3>1. Bid at the Sale</h3>
        <p>
          At the <strong>Junior Livestock Sale</strong>, you can purchase animals raised by 4-H youth. It’s the final
          step in our project and a reward for the hard work we’ve put in.<br>
          This year, I’ll be selling my <strong>rabbit and turkey</strong>. Buying one of my animals is a direct way to
          support my project and help fund future educational goals.
          The sale will be held on August 7 at 5:00 p.m. Location: 1542 E 73rd S, Idaho Falls, ID 83404
        </p>

        <h3>2. Give an Add-On</h3>
        <p>
          An <strong>add-on</strong> is a donation you give to an exhibitor (like me) even if you don’t buy an animal.
          Add-ons help cover the costs of feed, equipment, and more. You can give any amount, and it goes
          straight to the exhibitor.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>To give an add-on:</strong><br>
          - Contact the sale committee or auction office.<br>
          - Tell them you’d like to donate an add-on to:<br>
          <strong>Andrew Borlin – Rabbit & Turkey Project</strong><br>
          - They accept <strong>cash or check</strong>.<br>
          - Or, if it’s easier, you can <strong>Venmo me</strong>, and I’ll turn in the money directly for processing.

        </p>

        <p>
          Every bit of support helps—and it’s an investment in youth learning real-life skills that will last a
          lifetime.
